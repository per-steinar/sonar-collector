* SonarQube metrics collector

This is a utility to collect some key numbers for each SonarQube analysis triggered by maven builds. 

The purpose of this is to log statistics that shows the improvement of the code quality of the projects over time.

This utility consists of two parts:
 1. A maven plugin that is run after the sonar part of the build has run to completion, that will poll the REST API of Sonar for some key metrics of the build, and after gathering the data, do a POST to a different REST API to save the data
 2. A very simple web application that offers a REST API the maven plugin can POST to, and that will store the data in a PostgreSQL database
